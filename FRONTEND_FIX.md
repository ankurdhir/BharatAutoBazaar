# Frontend 401 Error Fix

## Problem
The Buy page is showing 401 errors even though it's a public page that doesn't require authentication.

## Root Cause
Invalid JWT tokens stored in localStorage are being sent with API requests, causing 401 errors.

## Solution

### Option 1: Browser Console Fix (Quick)
1. Open the Buy page (`http://localhost:3000/buy`)
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Run this command:
   ```javascript
   // Clear all tokens
   ['authToken', 'refreshToken', 'currentUser', 'adminToken', 'adminUser'].forEach(key => {
     if (localStorage.getItem(key)) {
       console.log('Clearing:', key);
       localStorage.removeItem(key);
     }
   });
   console.log('âœ… Tokens cleared, refreshing page...');
   location.reload();
   ```

### Option 2: Use Debug HTML (Comprehensive)
1. Open `frontend_debug.html` in your browser
2. Click "Check Tokens" to see what's stored
3. Click "Clear All Tokens" to remove them
4. Click "Test Cars API" to verify it works
5. Go back to the Buy page and refresh

### Option 3: Manual localStorage Clear
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Expand "Local Storage" in the left sidebar
4. Click on your localhost domain
5. Delete these keys if present:
   - `authToken`
   - `refreshToken`
   - `currentUser`
   - `adminToken`
   - `adminUser`
6. Refresh the page

## Verification
After clearing tokens:
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/buy`
2. You should see the car listing: "2024 Maruti Swift zxi"
3. Check browser console - you should see: `ðŸš« Skipping auth header (includeAuth=false)`
4. No 401 errors should appear

## Debug Info
- API works correctly without authentication (tested with Python script)
- Frontend is correctly passing `includeAuth: false` for public endpoints
- The issue was invalid tokens being sent despite the `includeAuth: false` setting

## Prevention
The token validation in `src/services/api.js` should automatically clear invalid tokens, but manual clearing ensures a clean state.
